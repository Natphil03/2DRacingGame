# 2DRacingGame
This Game was Made as Coursework for my A-Level Computer Science Course.

Developed my python knowledge and skills tremendously as well as being a fun project.

Skills developed:
- Classes
- Python Game development due to use of event loops and knowing what is required for it to function.


Some known issues:
- cannot win game directly due to no collision detection on finish line
- no collision detection on sides of track
- Running RaceTimer continues to click over after winning game


Feel free to use this code, can be helpful for reuseable components on future projects!
